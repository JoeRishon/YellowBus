# YellowBus

YELLOW BUS is an application that tracks a bus and gathers the distance to station along its route. The application involves the installation of an electronic device in the bus, with an installed Android App on any smart phone to enable the students to track the vehicle's location. Buses carry GPS devices to track their positions. By this, positions to server are periodically updated. The application displays map showing the position of bus. It shows where bus is on the google map and provide students the updated information at different time interval. The bus-driver/student will monitor location and will store its data in the database. It is a real-time system as this method automatically sends the information on the GPS system to system/SMART phone. Since this is an android application, we use firebase server database for the backend. The students can get flexibility of planning travel to college using the app, to decide on which bus to take or when to catch the bus. Simple mode of communication is the key feature of the YELLOW BUS application. 

This application can be easily extended for central tracking system to keep track of all the public vehicles. The different queries and efficient route management can be easily done through central server system.
